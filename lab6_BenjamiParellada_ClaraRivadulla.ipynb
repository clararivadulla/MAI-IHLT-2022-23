using the classic Lesk algorithm. In the first case, just using the given sentence and extracting the POS to identify the word, we see that it returns adequate results, however in closer inspection we see that some words matched should not really be matched. For example, we saw that not removing the stopwords, since these are not represented in the WordNet, will return us incorrect synsets about the word. Moreover, since these words are usually 2 letters long, it confuses them with words on the periodic table.\n","\n","The second Lesk implementation, fixed this by first checking if the word is a stopword and omitting the word if it was when using Lesk. We feel this is a more realistic approach to dealing with the words, since it is what we also did on the Lab 2 and Lab 3. Hence, it will be better for comparison as well. We can see that removing the stopwords gives us higher correlation to the gold standard, as the unexpected synsets we get from the stopwords are now removed.\n","\n","| Processing | Pearson $r$ |  \n","|------------|:---:|\n","| Lesk     | 0.482 |\n","| Lesk + Stopwords   | 0.508  |\n","\n","\n","Finally, since in these previous two implementations we only have compared the words that appeared in the WordNet with themselves, we decided to add those words that did not appear as their token. This will make the comparison between the previous lab sessions better, since otherwise we are inflating the results by not using all the text that appears (numbers, given names, etc.). We do not need to lemmatize these words, since lemmatizing also uses the WordNet, and if Lesk returns us that there is nothing, then there will be nothing to lemmatize as well. We also remove the stopwords and tokens that only contain non-alphanumeric symbols, to match the preprocessing of the previous sessions. Furthermore, we do not remove the symbols inside the synset representations (e.g. `vote.n.03` stays the same). With these restrictions, the resulting Pearson Correlations are given in the following table.\n","\n","| Processing | Pearson $r$ |  \n","|------------|:---:|\n","| Simple (Lab 2)    | 0.468 |\n","| Stemming (Lab 2)  | 0.462  |\n","| Lemmatizing (Lab 3) | 0.483  |\n","| **Lesk + Stopwords + Tokens** | **0.478**  |\n","\n","As we can see in the table, the use of Lesk returns pretty similar results to the previous Labs, better than just using the tokens directly as well as using Stemming. However, when compared to Lemmatizing, we seem to be obataining a bit worse results.\n","\n","Lesk basically gets the maximum intersection of the `context` sentence with the definitions of the synsets found from the ambiguous word, making it very sensitive to the exact wording of definitions. Hence, the absence of certain words can radically change the results. Moreover, it only checks overlaps among the glosses of the senses being considered, and these are usually not long enough to provide a good enough distinction.\n","\n","This can be seen clearly in some of the previous examples. Where, for instance, the word `vote` appeared and the result of the Lesk algorithm was two different results in significance:\n","\n","\n","- `The vote will take place today at 5.30 p.m.` $\\rightarrow$ `vote.n.04`\n","- `The vote will be to 17h30.`  $\\rightarrow$ `vote.n.05` (is this even a correct sentence?)\n","\n","Which makes our naive comparison fail, since we are checking if the whole word is a match. This could be fixed by just omitting the word function and entry used (everything after the point in the synset name). However, we were told by a higher power, our savior, Salvador, to not do it.\n","\n","Overall, the WDS seems a better approach to solving the STS problem, since it makes more sense to use the words and find their possible synset. Nevertheless, there are still some quirks to fix since some of these words are obtaining the wrong entry in the WordNet, making it fail the set intersection."],"metadata":{"id":"ZISPHCWzFH0V"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lXhg9BH45Dl0"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
