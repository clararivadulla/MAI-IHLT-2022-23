\n","\n","The places where the Lemma shines is when words with the same POS are written a bit differently, for example different forms of verb. However, sometimes the word appears with a different POS and the lemmatizer does not lemmatize the word to match, making them appear different in our naive set comparision.\n","\n","In 197 for example, we can see how \"disappointed\" is lemmatized in two different ways depending where its at. In the first sentence it appears as an adjective, while in the second it appears as a Verb, resulting in two different results after applying the lemmatizer. [We can even search in the WordNet the word to see the how the word is defined, to see this is the \"correct\" behavior of WordNet](http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=disappointed&sub=Search+WordNet&o2=&o0=1&o8=1&o1=1&o7=&o5=&o9=&o6=&o3=&o4=&h=00000). Similarly, for adverbs it can also occur that we do not get the root of the lemma, as seen with \"loved\" (verb) and \"lovely\" (adverb).\n","\n","However, this is not problem of the WordNet, but a problem in our POS tagger. Looking at the sentences, the words inactive, tired and disappointed are adjectives towards the subject, the fisherman. Hence, it mistakenly said they were verbs and made the wordnet fumble.\n","\n","Testing the forbidden arts of NLP with `spacy`, we can see how it correctly lemmatizes these pair of sentences by correctly attributing them to adjectives. \n","\n","This indicates us two things. First, that using a better POS tagger will improve our results in the paraphrasing task.
